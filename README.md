# Prototypes by Hoon

[Try](https://soohoon90.github.io/incremental-game/)

Bunch of html, css, js prototypes for fun. Some of these are curiosity of how to implement.

Most I want to try to make in vanilla JavaScript if possible, but may include borrowed code sometimes.

Goal is to have fun, learn, tinker, and get small satisfaction of making something.

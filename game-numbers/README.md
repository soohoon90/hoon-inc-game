* simple incremental game

rate is 1 point / second to begin with

there is a button
each time button is pressed, the rate goes up by 1.

the button has cost
the button is enabled when there's enough point
the button is disabled when there's not enough point

when the button is pressed, cost is deducted from the point
when the button is pressed, the cost increase, exponentially
cost = base cost + additional cost ^ level
